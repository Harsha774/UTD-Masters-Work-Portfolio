The dataset consists of the example data sets of various respiratory diseases,turned into epidemics and pandemics such as SARS,MERS and the latest Covid-19, with features including the location, spread, #deaths, #recovered,etc.

(Additional Idea - We can track market up/down during the diseases in the past, and update the impact of Global markets, that data would be available on websites(I guess). I think we would need to scrape this data)

We want to predict the impact of these viruses on the world,
1. How likely are you going to get the virus?
2. How likely are you going to get recovered if you get the virus?
3. Impact on the world markets
