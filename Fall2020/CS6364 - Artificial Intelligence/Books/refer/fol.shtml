     </li><li> Paraphrase: All those who may use service elevators are employees.
     </li><li> Note that in problem #7, u(X) referred to elevators, and in problem 
          #8, u(X) refers to employees.
     </li></ul>
     </div>
</li><li> All that glitters is not gold.
     <a href="#" onclick="showhide('answer009'); return(false);">Answer</a>
     <div style="display: none;" id="answer009">
     <ul>
     <li> &#8704;X (g(X) &#8658; ~a(X))
     </li><li> My translation, like the English original, says quite literally that 
          all that glitters is not gold.  It implies that gold, if it 
          glitters, is not gold, which is false.
     </li><li> The speaker of this proverb undoubtedly meant that we should not be 
          misled by glitter to think that we have found gold.  This truth 
          requires a 'not all' rather than an 'all not', and should be 
          translated ~&#8704;X (g(X) &#8658; a(X)) or &#8707;X (g(X) &amp; ~a(X)).
     </li><li> There are two natural but non-equivalent ways to translate 'all not' 
          sentences, such as 'All that glitters is not gold': &#8704;X ~(g(X) 
          &#8658; a(X)) and &#8704;X (g(X) &#8658; ~a(X)).  The former asserts 
          the absurdity that everything whatsoever glitters and everything 
          whatsoever is not gold.  The latter is the true 'all not' sentence: 
          for all things, if they glitter, then they are not gold. Remember 
          that "All A's are not B's" means "No A's are B's".
     </li></ul>
     </div>
</li><li> None but the brave deserve the fair.
     <a href="#" onclick="showhide('answer010'); return(false);">Answer</a>
     <div style="display: none;" id="answer010">
     <ul>
     <li> &#8704;X (d(X) &#8658; b(X))
     </li><li> This means: <em>only</em> the brave deserve the fair, which is the 
          converse of <em>all</em> the brave deserve the fair.  It is 
          equivalent to saying: All those who deserve the fair are 
          brave.
     </li></ul>
     </div>
</li><li> Not every visitor stayed for dinner.
     <a href="#" onclick="showhide('answer011'); return(false);">Answer</a>
     <div style="display: none;" id="answer011">
     <ul>
     <li> &#8707;X (v(X) &amp; ~s(X))
     </li><li> My translation says there is a visitor who did not stay; this seems 
          more accurate to me than &#8707;X ~(v(X) &amp; s(X)), or ~&#8704;X 
          (v(X) &#8658; s(X)): there is something that is not a visitor who 
          stayed, for example, my chalk.
     </li></ul>
     </div>
</li><li> Not any visitor stayed for dinner.
     <a href="#" onclick="showhide('answer012'); return(false);">Answer</a>
     <div style="display: none;" id="answer012">
     <ul>
     <li> &#8704;X (v(X) &#8658; ~s(X)), or ~&#8707;X (v(X) &amp; s(X))
     </li><li> 'Not any' = none = all did not = false that at least one did.
     </li></ul>
     </div>
</li><li> Nothing in the house escaped destruction.
     <a href="#" onclick="showhide('answer013'); return(false);">Answer</a>
     <div style="display: none;" id="answer013">
     <ul>
     <li> &#8704;X ~(h(X) &#8658; e(X)) and &#8704;X (h(X) &#8658; ~e(X)) are 
          both natural; but they are non-equivalent (see note to exercise 9).  
          The former says that being in the house didn't necessarily mean 
          destruction, clearly not the speaker's meaning.  The latter says 
          that everying in the house was destroyed.
     </li></ul>
     </div>
</li><li> Some students are both intelligent and hard workers.
     <a href="#" onclick="showhide('answer014'); return(false);">Answer</a>
     <div style="display: none;" id="answer014">
     <ul>
     <li> &#8707;X (s(X) &amp; i(X) &amp; h(X))
     </li><li> There is at least one thing possessing these three properties: being 
          a student, being intelligent, being a hard worker.  (This notation 
          is a natural for poetry!)
     </li></ul>
     </div>
</li><li> No coat is waterproof unless it has been specially treated.
     <a href="#" onclick="showhide('answer015'); return(false);">Answer</a>
     <div style="display: none;" id="answer015">
     <ul>
     <li> &#8704;X (c(X) &#8658; (~w(X) | s(X)))
     </li><li> If something is a coat, then it's either not waterproof or specially 
          treated.  This is an accurate translation; you'll have to get used 
          to turning sentences inside out like this on occasion.
     </li><li> Here I translated "unless" as inclusive disjunction.  If you want to 
          use exclusive disjunction, then say this: &#8704;X (c(X) &#8658; 
          (~w(X) &lt;~&gt; s(X)))
     </li></ul>
     </div>
</li><li> Some medicines are dangerous only if taken in excessive amounts.
     <a href="#" onclick="showhide('answer016'); return(false);">Answer</a>
     <div style="display: none;" id="answer016">
     <ul>
     <li> &#8707;X (m(X) &amp; (d(X) &#8658; e(X)))
     </li><li> This way of translating it commits us absolutely to the existence of 
          medicines, but only conditionally to their dangerousness, which is 
          what the speaker seems to want.
     </li><li> We avoid &#8707;X ((m(X) &amp; d(X)) &#8658; e(X)) because it is an 
          existentially quantified conditional.  It is equivalent to &#8707;X 
          (~(m(X) &amp; d(X)) | e(X)) which asserts that there is something that 
          is either not a dangerous medicine (like my chalk) or that is taken 
          in excessive amounts (like logic courses).

          disjunction.

     <li> &#8704;X (p(X) &#8658; (g(X) &#8660; (w(X) &amp; e(X))))

          &#8704;X ((p(X) &amp; g(X)) &#8660; (w(X) &amp; e(X))).  Mine says that all 
          professors are good iff they are well-informed and entertaining.  
          The equivalence is only asserted to hold for professors.  The latter 
          says that something is a good professor iff it is well-informed and 
          entertaining; the equivalence is asserted to hold in general, 
          implying that the puerile weather person on the local news is a 
          'good professor'.

          conditionals are usually undesirable, see comments to exercise 2, 
          below.)  The same is true for analogous variations on the exercises 
          below.
     </li><li> However, if we take the first of these unacceptable translations and 
          limit the scope of the first quantifier, then we no longer have an 
          existentially quantified conditional:  &#8707;X d(X) &#8658; &#8707;Y

          might want one here.  But like most existentially quantified 
          conditionals, &#8707;X (d(X) &#8658; c(X)) does not mean what we want 
          it to.  It is equivalent to &#8707;X (~d(X) | c(X)), which says that 
          there is something that is either not damaged or charged to the 
          tenant.  It commits us to the existence of that something; the 
          English does not.  Moreover, it is satisfied (made true) by my 
          chalk, since it is undamaged; and this is certainly not intended by 
          the speaker.
     </li><li> But &#8707;X (d(X) &amp; c(X)) is clearly worse, for it asserts that

          c(X))).  The trouble with this, however, is that creates an 
          existentially quantified conditional.  This is not one of the rare 
          cases where we really mean what an existentially quantified 
          conditional would say, however.  It would say (after a few 
          transformations that preserve equivalence) that there is something 
          that is either not a present officer or that has the property of 
          being a captain if all present officers are captains.  But this 
          sentence is satisfied by my chalk, since my chalk is not a present 
          officer.
     </li><li> Another tempting solution would be to retain the existential 
          quantifier but let its scope stop after the antecedent, and not 
          envelope the whole conditional:  &#8707;X (o(X) &amp; p(X)) &#8658; 
          (&#8704;Y ((o(Y) &amp; p(Y)) &#8658; c(Y)) &#8658; c(X))).  The problem 
          with this is that the "x" in the final c(X) is free; hence we will 
          have produced a propositional function (lacking a truth-value), 
          while the English sentence was a proposition (bearing a truth-value).
     </li><li> Notice that both my translation and the English sentence are 
          non-committal on the existence of present officers.  This supports 
          the decision to use a universal quantifier.
     </li><li> Also notice how the particular-seeming "they" does not compel an 
          existential quantifier.  This is true even of the "he" in exercise 
          20, below.  Recall this usage in other, more familiar English 
          sentences.  "The horse is a noble animal; <em>she</em> swats flies 
          with her tail. "  This is clearly a statement about all horses that 
          would take a universal quantifier.

     </li><li> Like the English sentence, my translation does not explicitly say 
          that this lawyer is his own client, or that this lawyer is a fool.   
          These propositions follow, of course, but the wit of the original 
          lies in leaving them implicit.   At first we think the lawyer and 
          client differ; then we infer that they are the same, and we thereby 
          know who the fool is.   We can make these implicit meanings explicit 
          thus:  &#8704;X ((l(X) &amp; p(X,X)) &#8658; (c(X,X) &amp; f(X))).
     </li><li> An existential quantifier on 'y' would say:  for all lawyers, and at 
          least one client. . . ".   It may be true that all lawyers who plead 
          their own cases have at least one foolish client, but this wouldn't 
          guarantee the inference that one of the foolish clients is the 
          lawyer him/herself.   This paraphrase of the original shows why the 
          universal quantifier is appropriate:  all clients of lawyers who are 
          pleading their own cases are fools.

     </li><li> The quantifier on psychiatrists ('y') is existential because we mean

          structure explicit, we could define new predicates, h(X), "x is a 
          head", and e(X,Y), "x ought to be examined by y".   Replacing o(X) 
          with these finer-grained predicates gives us: &#8704;X &#8704;Y

          &#8704;X &#8704;Y ((p(X) &#8658; ~l(X,Y)) | t(X,Y,X)).   I prefer 
          exclusive disjunction (the negation of material equivalence) because 
          we seem to mean that the two propositions cannot both be true.   If 
          we learn that the second is true, we will retract our affirmation of 
          the first.
     </li><li> The existential quantifier on what is learned ('y') means that we 
          are saying:  no one ever learns something or another (at least one 
          thing) unless. . . .   If it were universal, we'd be sdaying:  no 
          one every learns all things unless. . . .
     </li><li> One of the central meanings of this English sentence can be 
          expressed quite simply without the troublesome "unless":  &#8704;X 
          &#8707;Y ((p(X) &amp; l(X,Y)) &#8658; t(X,Y,X)).   This says:  All people

     </li><li> We could avoid 's' as a constant for the sun, and introduce the 
          predicate s(X) = "x is the sun", and so on for m, t, d, and n.   We 
          can always replace individuals with suitable predicates because to 
          be a particular individual (e. g.  the sun) is equivalent to being 
          an arbitrary individual, x, with the attribute of being that 
          particualr individual (e. g.  the attribute of being the sun).   But 
          to treat individuals in that way would add complexity to the 
          translation without improving its accuracy.
